"""
This code is a Python program for a tip calculator. It asks the user for the total bill
amount, the percentage of tip they want to add (choices: 15%, 18%, 20%), and the 
number of people splitting the bill.

The code then calculates the tip amount based on the bill and tip percentage, adds it 
to the total bill amount, and divides the total bill by the number of people to get 
the amount each person needs to pay.

Finally, it displays the total bill amount including the tip and the amount each person 
needs to pay. This code extends the original bill calculator by adding the 
functionality to include a tip before splitting the bill among the people."""
